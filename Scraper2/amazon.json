These purposes include: \n \n\t\t\n \n \n Purchase and delivery of products and services.  We use your personal information to take and handle orders, deliver products and services, process payments, and communicate with you about orders, products and services, and promotional offers. \n \n\n \n Provide, troubleshoot, and improve Amazon Services.

We use your personal information to communicate with you in relation to Amazon Services via different channels (e.g., by phone, e-mail, chat). \n \n\n \n Advertising.  We use your personal information to display interest-based ads for features, products, and services that might be of interest to you. We do not use information that personally identifies you to display interest-based ads. To learn more, please read our  Interest-Based Ads  notice  . \n \n\n \n Fraud Prevention and Credit Risks.  We use personal information to prevent and detect fraud and abuse in order to protect the security of our customers, Amazon, and others. We may also use scoring methods to assess and manage credit risks. \n \n \n\t\t\n \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n \n \n  What About Cookies and Other Identifiers?   \n To enable our systems to recognize your browser or device and to provide and improve Amazon Services, we use cookies and other identifiers. For more information about cookies and how we use them, please read our  Cookies Notice  . \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n \n \n  Does Amazon Share Your Personal Information?   \n Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling our customers’ personal information to others. We share customers’ personal information only as described below and with subsidiaries Amazon.com, Inc. controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice. \n \n\t\t\n  \n \n   Transactions involving Third Parties:  We make available to you services, products, applications, or skills provided by third parties for use on or through Amazon Services. For example, you can order products from third parties through our stores, download applications from third-party application providers from our App Store, and enable third-party skills through our Alexa services. We also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party businesses, such as co-branded credit cards. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share customers’ personal information related to those transactions with that third party. \n \n \n \n   Third-Party Service Providers:  We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing payments, transmitting content, scoring, assessing and managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These third-party service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. \n \n \n \n Business Transfers:  As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon.com, Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. \n \n \n \n   Protection of Amazon and Others:  We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our  Conditions of Use   and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. \n \n \n\t\t\n \n\n Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal information about you might be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information. \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n \n \n  How Secure Is Information About Me?   \n We design our systems with your security and privacy in mind. \n \n\t\t\n  \n \n We work to protect the security of your personal information during transmission by using encryption protocols and software.  \n \n \n \n We follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) when handling credit card data.  \n \n \n \n We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage, and disclosure of personal customer information. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you. \n \n \n \n Our devices offer security features to protect them against unauthorized access and loss of data. You can control these features and configure them based on your needs.   Click  here   for more information on how to manage the security settings of your device. \n \n\n \n It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computers, devices, and applications.

Third-party advertising partners may collect information about you when you interact with their content, advertising, and services. For more information about third-party advertising at Amazon, including interest-based ads, please read our  Interest-Based Ads  policy  . To adjust your advertising preferences, please go to the  Advertising Preferences  page  . \n \n\n \n Use of Third-Party Advertising Services:  We provide ad companies with information that allows them to serve you with more useful and relevant Amazon ads and to measure their effectiveness. We never share your name or other information that directly identifies you when we do this. Instead, we use an advertising identifier like a cookie or other device identifier. For example, if you have already downloaded one of our apps, we will share your advertising identifier and data about that event so that you will not be served an ad to download the app again. Some ad companies also use this information to serve you relevant ads from other advertisers. You can learn more about how to opt-out of interest-based advertising by going to the  Advertising Preferences  page  . \n \n \n\t\t\n \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n \n \n  What Information Can I Access?    \n You can access your information, including your name, address, payment options, profile information, Prime membership, household settings, and purchase history in the 'Your Account' section of the website.

When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records. \n \n \n \n If you do not want to receive e-mail or other communications from us, please adjust your  Customer Communication Preferences  . If you don’t want to receive in-app notifications from us, please adjust your notification settings in the app or device.  \n \n \n \n If you do not want to see interest-based ads, please adjust your  Advertising Preferences  . \n \n \n \n The Help feature on most browsers and devices will tell you how to prevent your browser or device from accepting new cookies or other identifiers, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to block cookies altogether. Because cookies and identifiers allow you to take advantage of some essential features of Amazon Services, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use any Services that require you to Sign in. For more information about cookies and other identifiers, see our  Cookies Notice  . \n \n \n \n If you want to browse our websites without linking the browsing history to your account, you may do so by logging out of your account    here   and blocking cookies on your browser. \n \n\n \n You will also be able to opt out of certain other types of data usage by updating your settings on the applicable Amazon website (e.g., in 'Manage Your Content and Devices'), device, or application. For more information   click  here  . Most non-Amazon devices also provide users with the ability to change device permissions (e.g., disable/access location services, contacts). For most devices, these controls are located in the device's settings menu. If you have questions about how to change your device permissions on devices manufactured by third parties, we recommend you contact your mobile service carrier or your device manufacturer. \n \n\n \n If you are a seller, you can add or update certain information in    Seller Central  , update your account information by accessing your    Seller Account Information  , and adjust your e-mail or other communications you receive from us by updating your    Notification Preferences  . \n \n\n \n If you are an author, you can add or update the information you have provided in the    Author Portal   and    Author Central   by accessing your accounts in the Author Portal and Author Central, respectively. \n \n \n\t\t\n \n \n In addition, to the extent required by applicable law, you may have the right to request access to or delete your personal data. If you wish to do any of these things, please contact  Customer Service  . Depending on your data choices, certain services may be limited or unavailable. \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n \n \n  Are Children Allowed to Use Amazon Services?    \n Amazon does not sell products for purchase by children. We sell children's products for purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you may use Amazon Services only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.

We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.  \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n \n \n Related Practices and Information \n  \n\t\t\n  \n \n   Conditions of Use   \n \n \n \n   Seller Program Policies    \n \n \n \n   Help Department   \n \n \n \n   Most Recent Purchases    \n \n \n \n   Your Profile and Community Guidelines    \n \n \n\t\t\n \n\n\n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n \n \n  Examples of Information Collected    \n \n Information You Give Us When You Use Amazon Services  \n \n\n You provide information to us when you: \n \n\t\t\n \n \n search or shop for products or services in our stores;

The licenses granted by Amazon terminate if you do not comply with these Conditions of Use or any Service Terms. \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n \n \n YOUR ACCOUNT \n You may need your own Amazon account to use certain Amazon Services, and you may be required to be logged in to the account and have a valid payment method associated with it. If there is a problem charging your selected payment method, we may charge any other valid payment method associated with your account. Visit https://www.amazon.com/cpe/managepaymentmethods?ref_=ya_d_c_pmt_mpo& to manage your payment options. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password and for restricting access to your account, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. Amazon does sell products for children, but it sells them to adults, who can purchase with a credit card or other permitted payment method. If you are under 18, you may use the Amazon Services only with involvement of a parent or guardian. Parents and guardians may create profiles for teenagers in their Amazon Household. Alcohol listings on Amazon are intended for adults. You must be at least 21 years of age to purchase alcohol, or use any site functionality related to alcohol. Amazon reserves the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, terminate your rights to use Amazon Services, remove or edit content, or cancel orders in its sole discretion. \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n \n \n REVIEWS, COMMENTS, COMMUNICATIONS, AND OTHER CONTENT   \n You may post reviews, comments, photos, videos, and other content; send e-cards and other communications; and submit suggestions, ideas, comments, questions, or other information, so long as the content is not illegal, obscene, threatening, defamatory, invasive of privacy, infringing of intellectual property rights (including publicity rights), or otherwise injurious to third parties or objectionable, and does not consist of or contain software viruses, political campaigning, commercial solicitation, chain letters, mass mailings, or any form of 'spam' or unsolicited commercial electronic messages. You may not use a false e-mail address, impersonate any person or entity, or otherwise mislead as to the origin of a card or other content. Amazon reserves the right (but not the obligation) to remove or edit such content, but does not regularly review posted content. \n \n If you do post content or submit material, and unless we indicate otherwise, you grant Amazon a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, perform, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and display such content throughout the world in any media. You grant Amazon and sublicensees the right to use the name that you submit in connection with such content, if they choose. You represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the content that you post; that the content is accurate; that use of the content you supply does not violate this policy and will not cause injury to any person or entity; and that you will indemnify Amazon for all claims resulting from content you supply. Amazon has the right but not the obligation to monitor and edit or remove any activity or content. Amazon takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any content posted by you or any third party. \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n \n \n INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COMPLAINTS \n Amazon respects the intellectual property of others. If you believe that your intellectual property rights are being infringed, please follow our  Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement . \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n \n \n RISK OF LOSS \n All purchases of physical items from Amazon are made pursuant to a shipment contract. This means that the risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon our delivery to the carrier. \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n \n \n RETURNS, REFUNDS AND TITLE   \n Amazon does not take title to returned items until the item arrives at our fulfillment center. At our discretion, a refund may be issued without requiring a return. In this situation, Amazon does not take title to the refunded item. For more information about our returns and refunds, please see our  Returns Center  . \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n \n \n PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS \n Amazon attempts to be as accurate as possible. However, Amazon does not warrant that product descriptions or other content of any Amazon Service is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. If a product offered by Amazon itself is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition.  \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n \n \n PRICING   \n 'List Price' means the suggested retail price of a product as provided by a manufacturer, supplier, or seller. We regularly check List Prices against prices recently found on Amazon and other retailers. Certain products may have a 'Was Price' displayed, which is determined using recent price history of the product on Amazon. \n \n With respect to items sold by Amazon, we cannot confirm the price of an item until you order. Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items in our catalog may be mispriced. If the correct price of an item sold by Amazon is higher than our stated price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before shipping or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. Other merchants may follow different policies in the event of a mispriced item.  \n \n We generally do not charge your credit card until after your order has entered the shipping process or, for digital products, until we make the digital product available to you. \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n \n \n APP PERMISSIONS \n When you use apps created by Amazon, such as the Amazon App or Kindle App, you may grant certain permissions to us for your device. Most mobile devices provide you with information about these permissions. To learn more about these permissions,  click here  .  \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n \n \n SANCTIONS AND EXPORT POLICY \n You may not use any Amazon Service if you are the subject of U.S. sanctions or of sanctions consistent with U.S. law imposed by the governments of the country where you are using Amazon Services. You must comply with all U.S. or other export and re-export restrictions that may apply to goods, software (including Amazon Software), technology, and services. \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n \n \n OTHER BUSINESSES \n Parties other than Amazon operate stores, provide services or software, or sell product lines through the Amazon Services. In addition, we provide links to the sites of affiliated companies and certain other businesses. If you purchase any of the products or services offered by these businesses or individuals, you are purchasing directly from those third parties, not from Amazon. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant, the offerings of any of these businesses or individuals (including the content of their Web sites). Amazon does not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, product, and content of all these and any other third parties. You should carefully review their privacy statements and other conditions of use.  \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n \n \n DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY  \n THE AMAZON SERVICES AND ALL INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) AND OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE AMAZON SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BY AMAZON ON AN 'AS IS' AND 'AS AVAILABLE' BASIS, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING. AMAZON MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE OPERATION OF THE AMAZON SERVICES, OR THE INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE AMAZON SERVICES, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE AMAZON SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. \n \n TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, AMAZON DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. AMAZON DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE AMAZON SERVICES, INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE AMAZON SERVICES, AMAZON'S SERVERS OR ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS SENT FROM AMAZON ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, AMAZON WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM THE USE OF ANY AMAZON SERVICE, OR FROM ANY INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH ANY AMAZON SERVICE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING. \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n \n \n DISPUTES \n \n Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any Amazon Service, or to any products or services sold or distributed by Amazon or through Amazon.com will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court , except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement. \n \n \n There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a court would. \n \n \n To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 300 Deschutes Way SW, Suite 304, Tumwater, WA 98501. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, Amazon will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. \n \n  \n We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.  If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration  we each waive any right to a jury trial . We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n \n \n APPLICABLE LAW   \n By using any Amazon Service, you agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state of Washington, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Conditions of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and Amazon. \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n \n \n SITE POLICIES, MODIFICATION, AND SEVERABILITY \n Please review our other policies, such as our  pricing policy , posted on this site. These policies also govern your use of Amazon Services. We reserve the right to make changes to our site, policies, Service Terms, and these Conditions of Use at any time. If any of these conditions shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition. \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n \n \n OUR ADDRESS  \n  \n\t\t\n Amazon.com, Inc.\nP.O.

You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble, tamper with, or bypass any security associated with the Amazon Software, whether in whole or in part. \n \n \n \n Updates.
